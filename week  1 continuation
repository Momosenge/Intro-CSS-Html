*HTML Capabilities 
HTML empowers us to create dynamic and interactive web pages.
We can add text, images, videos, forms, and more to engage users.

*Navigation and Linking Basics
Navigation elements like menus, buttons, and links guide users through websites.
Links connect different parts of a website, leading users to other pages or sections.

*Troubleshooting and Debugging 
When coding, things don't always work perfectly. We need to troubleshoot using tools like browser developer tools.
Issues like broken links and missing elements are common but fixable.
We ensure proper file paths and tag usage to resolve them.

*Attributes: The Building Blocks of HTML
Attributes add extra information to HTML tags, like specifying link destinations or image descriptions.
ARIA roles help people with disabilities navigate websites better by adding semantic meaning to elements.
We add ARIA roles to elements to improve accessibility, making it easier for assistive technologies to understand our content.

*Taming Unusual Characters and Formatting Challenges 
We encounter challenges like special characters or formatting issues that disrupt our web pages' appearance.
Special characters can confuse browsers, but HTML entities help display them correctly.
